What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge is when you combine two branches. This can be used to add code to only a specific portion of the codebase, while other people work on other portions. 
A rebase is when you move the "start" of your branch to a commit that was created after you initially created your branch. This can be used to get important code 
into your branch that was written after you created the branch.

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a git repo that is stored online. This can be used to allow teams to work on a project together more easily.
